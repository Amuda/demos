  "_DemoDescription": "In this demo we use SproutCore's built-in transition support to give our user interface some modern flourish.<br>As you can see we can choose from any of the six built-in SproutCore transitions:  Fade, Slide, Bounce, Spring, Scale and Pop, as well as a custom built transition: Twist, all of which are hardware accelerated when supported by the platform.<br>The most interesting part of this demo isn't the animations though, the most interesting part is <em style=\"font-style: italic;\">how incredibly simple it is to add transitions to your views</em>.  With only a single line of code, we can add transitions for appending views (<code>transitionIn</code>), for removing views (<code>transitionOut</code>), for making hidden views visible (<code>transitionShow</code>), for making visible views hidden (<code>transitionHide</code>) and for adjusting views (<code>transitionAdjust</code>).<br><br>For example, the entry transition of the three boxes is achieved with just: <pre style=\"padding: 10px;\">transitionIn: SC.View.SLIDE_IN</pre><br>Key SproutCore technologies used in this demo: SC.View, SC.ViewTransitionProtocol.",
