As you can see we can choose from any of the six built-in SproutCore transitions:  FADE, SLIDE, BOUNCE, SPRING, SCALE and POP as well as a custom built transition: TWIST, all of which are hardware accelerated when supported by the platform.<br>The most interesting part of the demo is how incredibly simple it is to specify a transition for newly added views (<code>transitionIn</code>), for made visible views (<code>transitionShow</code>), for made hidden views (<code>transitionHide</code>), and for removed views (<code>transitionOut</code>).<br><br>For example, the entry transition of the views is achieved with a single line: <pre style=\"padding: 10px;\">transitionIn: SC.View.SLIDE</pre><br>Key SproutCore technologies used in this demo: SC.View, SC.TransitionProtocol.",
