What is amazing about this is that the content consists of <strong>50,000 names</strong>!<br><br>In any other type of web app, you'd have to resort to showing only a small list of names at a time or else the app would become unusable at even a fraction of the total items displayed, but observe how SproutCore is able to scroll smoothly through the entire list and bring in data seamlessly in the background.<br><br>This demo also includes the extremely difficult task of inserting group items on demand within sparse data.<br><br>Key SproutCore technologies used in this demo: SC.SparseArray, SC.ListView, SC.ArrayController, SC.Query, SC.Request, SC.Store, SC.Record, SC.DataSource and SC.CascadeDataSource.",
