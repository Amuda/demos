This demo also includes a demonstration of the extremely difficult task of inserting group items on demand within sparse data.<br><br>Key SproutCore technologies used in this demo: SC.SparseArray, SC.ListView, SC.ArrayController, SC.Query, SC.Request, SC.Store, SC.Record, SC.DataSource and SC.CascadeDataSource.",
