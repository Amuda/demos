  "_DemoDescription": "In this demo we have an SC.ListView that displays one of two sparsely populated lists of content.  What is amazing about this is that the content consists of <strong>50,000 names</strong> that are paged in from the server on demand.<br><br>In any other type of web app, you'd have to resort to showing only a small list of data at a time, but observe how SproutCore is able to scroll smoothly through the entire list and bring in data seamlessly in the background.<br><br>This demo includes the extremely difficult task of inserting group items on demand into sparse data.
